We want to introduce the smart system project of our group here. Our final product is displayed in the form of a website. This is the initial page of our website. Click start to jump to the main page of face recognition. There are three websites in our website The functions are face recognition, emotion recognition, and camera capture, which can be selected from the sidebar. The first function is face recognition. This function requires us to upload a photo, the file type is jpg or png, upload the photo Finally, we only need to wait for a while to get all kinds of information about this person, know what his name is, and if the person is famous, it will also display his specific information on Wikipedia. The second function is emotion recognition. It still needs to upload a photo. After uploading the photo, it can display the personâ€™s emotions, such as happiness, sadness, fear, etc. The third function is camera capture. This function integrates the previous The two functions first require the computer to have a camera. After the camera is turned on to take a photo, the system will judge who the person is and how emotional he is based on the obtained photo. These are the three functions of our smart system. Please note that our smart system is not so powerful that it can recognize everyone. It needs to provide a certain number of photos for training. The photos should indicate who the photos are (minimum 20 pictures can guarantee the stability of recognition), now only the photos of team member Zhang Wenyue and one hundred world celebrities can be recognized. Finally, regarding the actual application prospect of our smart system, We think it can be used in companies to clock in at work. It only needs to be identified in front of the camera to determine the identity of the employee, and at the same time obtain the emotion of the employee to complete the clock in. That's all, thank you.
